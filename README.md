This iOS application has the basic idea to upload videos about singing, get likes and comments on those. 
On each month the most liked video would get a present from the app owner.

# Status

Because of some misunderstanding with owner and other developers for other platforms, the owner decided to stop the development process.
Even though, the iOS application was ready for the App Store.

# Technology

I worked with the SwiftComposableArchitecture library (Pointfreeco) and the IGKitList library (Instagram) to have a nice scrollable pagination vertically.
